# phaser-indent

A companion library to [phaser](https://github.com/quickdudley/phaser) for
constructing indentation aware parsers.

This is being written primarily for
[my language project](https://github.com/quickdudley/phaser), which will
interpret indentation differently from any existing language, but this library
will support user-supplied indentation rules so will be usable for any
indentation sensitive grammar.
